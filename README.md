# FileChecker

This is a python code that reads a file and checks if each line has up to a user given character length. All the lines that are less than the user given character length is added to a new file. The new file name to be created, the maximum character length and the file to process on are all entered into the program on start.

## How to Use

1. Put the file to be checked into the same folder containing the `checker.py` file.
2. Run the `checker.py` file.
3. Enter the requested values such as:
   - The name of the file to be checked
   - The name for the new file containing the result.
   - The number of characters that each line must be up to.
